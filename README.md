# Quizzical

## Author's Thoughts

This is my first full on react project to further test my React skills and become even more familiar with JSX syntax. The quiz app calls from the Open Trivia Database and generates random trivia questions for the user to answer.
I can't say that this was easy for me as it was much more complicated than expected things got complicated really quick. After several iterations finally have something i can share. Definately not the best but its where i am at currently.
